# Final Analysis
    From the data, we can see that the drug, Capomulin, shows the most promise in reducing the tumor sizes in the tested mice. The box and whisker chart shows Capomulin and Ramicane with much lower average tumor sizes at the end of the trial. However, the tumor size is highly correlated with the size of the mouse and there are still other variables that have not been evaluated, so it is still too early to say if this drug is the best to use going forward.
